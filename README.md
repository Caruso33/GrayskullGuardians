# Grayskull Guardians

## Overview
Grayskull Guardians, developed for the EthGlobal Istanbul Hackathon, enhances Ethereum solo staking with three core features:
1. **MEV Smoothie Pool**: Optimizes and incentivizes staking, improving solo staker rewards.
2. **Incentivized Rewards Through Public Good Funding**: Boosts the reward pool through public contributions.
3. **Compounded Rewards with Auto Swaps into rETH**: Efficiently optimizes fees by batching transactions to Layer 2 networks.
4. **MEV Blocking**: We initiate MEV-Boost of Cowswap as the standard RPC which prevents user from MEV attack on our App.
